# CoffeeCart
 ## Ghodrat's Coffee Cart
Recently, Ghodrat decided to open his very own little coffee cart on a busy street corner.
Being the careful entrepreneur, she decided to start off with a limited offering, with the option to expand his choice of products, as business goes.

 ## Offering  Products
- Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF - Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF
- Freshly squeezed orange juice (0.25l) 3.95 CHF
  ###  Extras:
- Extra milk 0.30 CHF
- Foamed milk 0.50 CHF
- Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF
## Bonus Program
  Ghodrat's idea is to attract as many regularâ€˜s as possible to have a steady turnaround. She decides to offer a customer stamp card, where every 5th beverage is for free.
  If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.
  Your task is to:
  Write a simple program whose output is formatted like a receipt you would receive at a supermarket.
  The input to the program is a list of products the shopper wants to purchase (large coffee with extra milk, small coffee with special roast, bacon roll, orange juice)
